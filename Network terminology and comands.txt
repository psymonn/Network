uniqure 48-bit (hecadecimal) MAC address
OSI Model layer 2 (data link layer) switch and bridge
OSI model layer 3 (Network layers) switches support routing, memory to store a mac add table
OSI model layer 3 (Network layers) router; memory to store a routing table (make best decision to transmitt packet to remote network)


VLANs:
improve security and performance


wireshark:
tcp.stream eq 0


Subnetmask:
Subnetmask is compare against the IP address to identify which portion of that address and identify the host and workout which on its resides.
use to seperate the host and network portions of an ip address

       (1) (1) (1) (0)
/24 or 255.255.255.0   = first 3 octet is the network e.g 199.126.129.
(host is the last octet) = 199.126.129.78   (78 is the host)

Why Subnet any further?
say you got a single network address
and there is a need to address multiple internal networks and you can't get an addition network addresses
The only way to to further subnet.

--------------------------------
Example of spliting 3 subnets
--------------------------------
200.1.1.0/24 where zero in this case is a network address not a host address

200.1.1 is our network

sincenario - we got 3 internal network address that the router is connected too, we need to supply address for it
solution: steal host bits to address subnets
There are 24bits bits mask for a given network
that mean there is only 8 host bits left
sincenario - 3 subnets must be addressed

2^2-2 = 2 - not enough   (^2 is how many host bits do we want to steal)   -2 some network equipment address 0 & 1 as their subnet, we can't have binary 0 & binary 1 to address the subnet work
2^3 -2 = 6 - more than enough subnet address (steal 3 host bits, now we got 6 subnet addresses)

old subnet mask: /24 or 255.255.255.0
new subnet mask: /27 or 255.255.255.224

Subnet addresses:
Remember three host bits are being used for subnets                                         (0)  (0) (1) (0) (0) (0) (0) (0)
The right most turned on bit (11100000) 3 bits on, has a decimal value of 32 (00100000)  -> 128, 64, 32, 16,  8, 4,  2  , 1
therefore 32 is the subnet factor number
first subnet has an addres of 32 i.e Subnet - 200.1.1.32
next subnet is another factor of 32  Subnet - 200.1.1.64
next subnet is another factor of 32  Subnet - 200.1.1.96

Subet 32 usable Ip addresses:
Subnet    - 200.1.1.32
First IP  - 200.1.1.33
Last IP   - 200.1.1.62
          - 200.1.1.63 is the broadcast for Subnet 32
          - 200.1.1.64 is the address of the next subnet

Subnet 64 usable Ip addreses:
Subnet    - 200.1.1.64
First IP  - 200.1.1.65
Last IP   - 200.1.1.94
          - 200.1.1.95 is the broadcast for Subnet 64
          - 200.1.1.64 is the address of the next subnet

Subnet 96 usable Ip addreses:
Subnet    - 200.1.1.96
First IP  - 200.1.1.97
Last IP   - 200.1.1.128
          - 200.1.1.129 is the broadcast for Subnet 64
          - 200.1.1.130 is the address of the next subnet


default gateway:
default gateway is the exit door, is how we transmit traffic outside our local area network (LAN)
the gateway has to be on the same subnet otherwise it won't work.
however DNS don't have to be on the same subnet.

ClassA:
first octet: 1-126
ClassB:
first octet: 128-191  (127 is reserved ranged)
ClassC:
first octet: 192-223
ClassD:
use for multicasting
ClassE:
Not used at all

IPv4
ipv4 is 32 bits long
are addressed in decimal form


ASA or ASAv
after reboot back into the ASA in an operational mode, also know was first mode or user mode


Mac address (Media Access Control):
MAC address tells who you are
IP address tells where you are

VLAN (Virtual LAN) - simply a broadcast domain

Switch -> f0/1, f0/2
Firewall -> g0/1, g0/2  (or gateway?)

Broadcast domain:
allow ip to broacast whether differenct ip subnet if it not vlan tag, but will be rejected by different subnet
only accept if it on the same subnet

ping:
ping -t 10.0.0.11  (continious ping)
